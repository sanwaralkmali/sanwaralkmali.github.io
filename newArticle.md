### The Battle System

IN LARGE SCREENS: using only the keyboard

- **Player 1** uses **QWER** keys
- **Player 2** uses **UIOP** keys
- Each player has their own color that lights up when they answer.
- First Player select an option --> his answer will be checked (few seconds) and the other options will be disabled in the checking time -->
- if He get correct answer --> he gets the questio points.
- but if he gets wrong answer --> he loses the question points (even if he has not points he will get negative points!)
- When an option is wrong the 2 players have another chance to select another option and same thing will happen.
- Questions appear one at a time
- First to answer correctly gets points!
- That wrong option gets locked (can't choose it again)
- Stay on the same question to try again
- only If you pick 3 wrong answers, the question is skipped

IN Touch SCREENS:
Touch screens works fine , every option card is divided into 2 equal areas (left , right)
Player 1 should touch the left half of the option card
Player 2 the right half of the option card

## (it's not the perfect experience you can have in small devices but I am looking for ideas to improve the game logic for small devices)
