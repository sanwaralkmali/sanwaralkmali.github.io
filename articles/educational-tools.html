            <p>What if educational tools actually taught students how to think, instead of just giving them answers?</p>

            <p>That's the question that led me to build the <strong>Equation Solver</strong> — a tool designed to show
                students the process, not just the result.</p>

            <h2>Not Just Another Calculator</h2>

            <p>This tool was built for a specific purpose — to help students understand how to solve equations (linear
                and quadratic for now), but unlike regular equation solvers that just give you the final answer or show
                the steps in static text, this tool animates each step, showing how the equation transforms over time.
            </p>

            <p>It's designed mainly for students who aren't looking for shortcuts, but who actually want to understand
                how to solve linear and quadratic equations.</p>

            <h2>The Real Problem Students Face</h2>

            <p>I notice that many students don't struggle with the final answer — they struggle with how we get there.
                Especially when solving equations, one missed step or confusing transformation can throw them off
                completely.</p>

            <p>Think about it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You're solving 2x + 3 = 7</li>
                <li>You subtract 3 from both sides</li>
                <li>But wait, did you remember to subtract from both sides?</li>
                <li>And what about that negative sign?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>One small mistake, and the whole process falls apart.</p>

            <h2>What If We Made the Process Visible?</h2>

            <p>So what if I make the steps visible, one by one, with smooth transitions that show how each part of the
                equation changes?</p>

            <p>That's exactly what this tool does.</p>

            <div class="tool-preview">
                <h3>Interactive Equation Solver</h3>
                <p>Watch as each step unfolds with smooth animations, showing exactly how the equation transforms from
                    start to finish.</p>
                <a href="https://equations-animated-solution.vercel.app/" target="_blank" class="cta-button">
                    <i class='bx bx-calculator'></i>
                    Try the Equation Solver
                </a>
            </div>

            <h2>This Is Part of Something Bigger</h2>

            <p>This is part of a bigger direction I'm working on:</p>

            <blockquote>Building educational tools that focus on clarity, interactivity, and simplicity.</blockquote>

            <p>I'm not trying to compete with large platforms — just experimenting with ways to make learning more
                understandable.</p>

            <h2>What Makes This Different?</h2>

            <p>Most equation solvers out there either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Give you the final answer instantly (which doesn't help you learn)</li>
                <li>Show static steps that you have to read through (which can be confusing)</li>
                <li>Assume you already understand the process (which many students don't)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This tool is different because it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Animates each step</strong> — you can see the equation actually changing</li>
                <li><strong>Shows the process</strong> — not just the result</li>
                <li><strong>Makes it visual</strong> — you can see what's happening to each part</li>
                <li><strong>Goes at your pace</strong> — you control when to move to the next step</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>More Tools Are Coming</h2>

            <p>This is just the beginning. More tools are coming soon, and I'll keep sharing them here.</p>

            <p>Each tool will follow the same principle: <strong>focus on understanding, not just getting
                    answers</strong>.</p>

            <h2>I'd Love Your Feedback</h2>

            <p>If you try the equation solver, I'd love to hear your feedback to improve or build new educational tools.
            </p>

            <p>What subjects do you think would benefit from this kind of animated, step-by-step approach?</p>

            <p>What tools do you wish existed when you were learning?</p>
