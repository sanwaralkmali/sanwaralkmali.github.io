            <p>I've been teaching math for years. And honestly? Some days, it feels like I'm the one doing most of the
                learning.</p>

            <p>I learn from my students all the time — especially the ones who say they</p>

            <blockquote>"I don't like math."</blockquote>

            <p>You know the ones:</p>

            <blockquote>"Why are we even learning this?"</blockquote>

            <p>At first, those comments used to frustrate me. But over time, I started listening more carefully. And
                what I heard… surprised me.</p>

            <h2>"I'm Not Good at Math" — But They're Amazing at Games?!</h2>

            <p>Here's the twist:</p>
            <p>The same students who struggle with equations or graphs often shine when we play games.</p>
            <p>They light up.</p>
            <p>They compete.</p>
            <p>They laugh.</p>
            <p>They focus.</p>

            <p>It didn't matter if it was a digital game, a board game, or just a quick activity to review a concept —
                when learning became a game, they were all in.</p>

            <h2>That Got Me Thinking…</h2>
            <p>If they dislike the subject but love the game, why not bring both together?</p>

            <blockquote>What if learning could feel like playing?</blockquote>

            <p>That's what sparked Mathlogame — a small project I started in my free time. It's a platform where
                students can learn math by playing short, engaging games. No big tech team. Just me, trying to solve a
                problem I saw in my own classroom every day.</p>

            <p>I made it because I needed it.</p>
            <p>And maybe other teachers do too.</p>

            <h2>It's Not Perfect — But It's Real</h2>
            <p>The prototype is live.</p>
            <p>It's not polished.</p>
            <p>It's not fancy.</p>
            <p>But it works.</p>

            <p>When my students use it, I see something shift in them.</p>
            <p>They try.</p>
            <p>They engage.</p>
            <p>They care — even if just a little more than before.</p>

            <p>And honestly, that's enough for me… for now.</p>

                <h3>MATHLOGAME</h3>
                <p>This game is designed to help you classify numbers into different categories based on their
                    properties. Learn about…</p>

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>Right now, it's just focused on math.</p>
            <p>But one day, I hope it becomes more — a space where learning feels less like pressure… and more like
                curiosity.</p>

            <p>If you're a teacher who believes school shouldn't feel like a punishment, maybe we can build something
                better — together.</p>

            <h2>A Final Note to Fellow Teachers</h2>
            <p>If you're tired,</p>
            <p>If your students are tired,</p>
            <p>If nothing seems to stick…</p>

            <blockquote>Try a game.<br>
                Just one.<br>
                It might surprise you.</blockquote>

            <p>Let's keep trying.</p>
            <p>Let's keep building.</p>
            <p>Let's make classrooms a place students want to be in — not just somewhere they have to be.</p>
